# Statement

Suppose $\alpha$ increases on $[a,b]$, $a \leq x_0 \leq b$, $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$, $f(x_0)=1$, and $f(x) = 0$ if $x \neq x_0$.
Prove that $f \in \riemann(\alpha)$ and that $\int f \d\alpha=0$.

# Solution

Theorem 6.10 states that:

> Suppose $f$ is bounded on $[a,b]$, $f$ only has finitely many points of discontinuity on $[a,b]$ and $\alpha$ is continuous at every point at which $f$ is discontinuous.
> Then $f\in\riemann(\alpha)$.

Our $f$ is bounded in $[a,b]$ because $\forall x\in[a,b], 0\leq f(x) \leq 1$.
The only point where $f$ is discontinuous is $x_0$ and $\alpha$ is continuous at $x_0$.
So, by Theorem 6.10, we know that $f\in\riemann(\alpha)$.

Now we have to prove that $\int f\d{a} = 0$.
Because $f\in\riemann(\alpha)$ we know that

$$
\begin{align}
  & f\in\riemann(\alpha) \\
  \iff & \exists \int f\d{\alpha} = \lowerint f\d{\alpha} = \upperint f\d{\alpha} \\
  \imply & \int f\d{\alpha} = \lowerint f\d{\alpha} \\
  \iff & \int f\d{\alpha} = \sup L(P, f, \alpha)
\end{align}
$$

Now I claim for any partition $P$, that:

$$
L(P,f,\alpha) = 0
$$

Given any partition $P$ we know that for all $i$ where $x_i \leq x_0 \leq x_{i+1}$ there exists an $x\in(x_i,x_{i+1})$ where $x\neq 0$.
Therefore:
$$
m_i = \inf_{x\in[x_i,x_{i+1}]}f(x) = 0
$$
It follows that for all $i$, $m_i = 0$.
Therefore $L(P,f,\alpha) = 0$ by direct computation.

Because $L(P,f,\alpha) = 0$ for any $P$, it follows that $\sup L(P,f,\alpha) = 0$.
Continuing from above:

$$
\begin{align}
 & f\in\riemann(\alpha) \\
 \imply & \int f\d{\alpha} = \sup L(P,f,\alpha) \\
 \iff & \int f\d{\alpha} = 0
\end{align}
$$

Therefore $\int f\d{\alpha} = 0$.
