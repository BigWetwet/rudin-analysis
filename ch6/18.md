# Statement

Let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_3$ be curves in the complex plane, defined on $\closed{0}{2\pi}$ by

- $\gamma_1(t) = e^{it}$,
- $\gamma_2(t) = e^{2it}$ and
- $\gamma_3(t) = e^{2\pi i \sin(1/t)}

Show that these three curves have the same range, that $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are rectifiable,
that the length of $\gamma_1$ is $2\pi$, that the length of $\gamma_2$ is $4\pi$, and that $\gamma_3$ is not rectifiable.
