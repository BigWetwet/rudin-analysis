# Statement

Suppose $f$ is a real function on $(0,1]$ and $f\in\riemann$ on $[c,1]$ for every $c > 0$.
Define

$$
  \int_0^1 f(x)\d{x} = \lim_{c\to0}\int_c^1 f(x)\d{x}
$$

if this limit exists (and is finite).

(a) If $f\in\riemann$ on $[0,1]$, show that this definition of the integral agrees with the old one.
(b) Construct a function $f$ such that the above limit exists, although it fails to exist with $|f|$ in place of $f$.

# Solution
