# Statement

Show that integration by parts can sometimes be applied to the "improper" integrals defined in Exercises 7 and 8.
(State appropriate hypotheses, formulate a theorem, and prove it.)
For instance show that
$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos x}{1+x} \d{x} = \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{(1+x)^2} \d{x}.
$$
Show that one of these integrals converges *absolutely*, but that the other does not.

# Solution
