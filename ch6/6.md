# Statement

Let $P$ be the Cantor set constructed in Sec. 2.44.
Let $f$ be a bounded real function on $[0,1]$ which is continuous at every point outside $P$.
Prove that $f\in\riemann$ on $[0,1]$.
*Hint:* $P$ can be covered by finitely many segments whose total length can be made as small as desired.
Proceed as in Theorem 6.10.

# Solution
