# Statement

Let $P$ be the Cantor set constructed in Sec. 2.44.
Let $f$ be a bounded real function on $\closed{0}{1}$ which is continuous at every point outside $P$.
Prove that $f\in\riemann$ on $\closed{0}{1}$.
*Hint:* $P$ can be covered by finitely many segments whose total length can be made as small as desired.
Proceed as in Theorem 6.10.

# Solution

Here is a rehash of the Cantor Set from Chapter 2:

> Let $E_0$ be the interval $\closed{0}{1}$.
Remove the segment $\open{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}}$, and let $E_1$ be the union of the intervals
$$
\closed{0}{\frac{1}{3}},\closed{\frac{2}{3}}{1}
$$
Remove the middle thirds of these intervals, and let $E_2$ be the union of the intervals
$$
  \closed{0}{\frac{1}{9}},\closed{\frac{2}{9}}{\frac{3}{9}},\closed{\frac{6}{9}}{\frac{7}{9}},\closed{\frac{8}{9}}{1}
$$
Continuing this way, we obtain a sequence of compact sets $E_n$, such that:
>
> (a) $E_1 \supset E_2 \supset E_3 \supset\ldots$
> (b) $E_n$ is the union of of $2^n$ intervals, each of length $3^{-n}$.
>
> The set
$$
P = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n
$$
is called the *Cantor Set*.
$P$ is clearly compact and Theorem 2.36 shows that $P$ is not empty.

For reference, Theorem 2.36 states:

> If $\{K_\alpha\}$ is a collection of compact subsets of a metric space $X$ such that the intersection of every finite subcollection of $\{K_\alpha\}$ is nonempty, then $\bigcap K_\alpha$ is nonempty.

Now we will show $f\in\riemann$.
Fix an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$.
Because $f$ is bounded, define $M\equiv\sup|f(x)|$.
Because each set $E_n$ consists of $2^n$ intervals, each of length $3^{-n}$, then the total length covered by $E_n$ is $\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n$.

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n = 0
$$

So we can pick an $N$ such that the total length covered by $E_N$ is less than $\epsilon$.
From the definition of the Cantor set, we know that

$$
  E_1 \supset E_2 \supset E_3 \supset \ldots
$$

Therefore, because $A \supset B$ implies $A\cap B = B$, we can say that:

$$
\begin{align}
  & P = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}E_n \\
  \iff & P = E_1 \cap \bigcap_{n=2}^{\infty}E_n \\
  \imply & P = \bigcap_{n=2}^{\infty}E_n \\
  \iff & P = E_2 \cap \bigcap_{n=3}^{\infty}E_n \\
  &\vdots  \\
  \imply & P = \bigcap_{n=N}^{\infty}E_n
\end{align}
$$

Because $\forall n > N$, $E_N \supset E_n$, we know that

$$
\begin{align}
  & E_N \supseteq \bigcap_{n=N}^{\infty}E_n \\
  \imply & E_N \supseteq P
\end{align}
$$

Therefore every point in $P$ is in $E_N$.
We can extend the endpoints of the intervals in $E_N$ by an *arbitrarily small amount* (small enough that the length covered is still less than $\epsilon$) to ensure every point in $P$ is an interior point of this set.
Let's call this extension $E$.
$E$ is composed of intervals of the form $\closed{u_j}{v_j}$.
Because every point of $P$ is an *interior* point of $E$, we can remove the all the segments $\open{u_j}{v_j}$ from $\closed{0}{1}$.
This remaining set $K$ is compact.
Because $f$ is bounded and continuous on $K$ and $K$ is compact, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $K$.
So there exist a $\delta$ such that for all $s,t\in K$, where $|s - t| < \delta$ then:

$$
  |f(s) - f(t)| < \epsilon
$$

We will form a partition $P' = \{x_0,\ldots,x_n\}$ of $\closed{0}{1}$ where:

- Each $u_j$ occurs in $P'$.
- Each $v_j$ occurs in $P'$.
- No point in any $\open{u_j}{v_j}$ occurs in $P'$.
- If $x_{i-1}$ is not one of the $u_j$ then $\Delta x_i < \delta$.

Because $f$ is bounded, we know that for every $i$, $M_i - m_i \leq 2M$ and that $M_i - m_i \leq \epsilon$ if $x_{i-1}$ is not one of the $u_j$.
Therefore we know that:

$$
  U(P,f) - L(P,f) \leq \underbrace{(1 - 0)\epsilon}_{\text{overestimation on $K$}} + \underbrace{2M\epsilon}_{\text{$\open{u_j}{v_j}$ intervals}}
$$

Theorem 6.6 states:

> $f\in\riemann(\alpha)$ on $[a,b]$ if and only if for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a partition $P$ such that
$$
U(P,f,\alpha) - L(P,f,\alpha) < \epsilon
$$

Because our $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, then by Theorem 6.6, $f\in\riemann$.
