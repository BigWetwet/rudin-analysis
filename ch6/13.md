# Statement

Define

$$
f(x) = \int_x^{x+1}\sin(t^2)\d{t}
$$

(a) Prove that $|f(x)| < 1/x$ if $x > 0$.
*Hint:* Put $t^2 = u$ and integrate by parts, to show that $f(x)$ is equal to:
$$
\frac{\cos(x^2)}{2x} - \frac{\cos[(x+1)^2]}{2(x+1)} - \int_{x^2}^{(x+1)^2}\frac{\cos u}{4u^{3/2}}\d{u}
$$
Replace $\cos u$ by $-1$.
(b) Prove that
$$
  2xf(x) = \cos(x^2) - \cos[(x+1)^2] + r(x)
$$
where $|r(x)| < c/x$ and $c$ is a constant.
(c) Find the upper and lower limits of $xf(x)$, as $x\to\infty$.
(d) Does $\int_0^\infty\sin(t^2)\d{t}$ converge?
