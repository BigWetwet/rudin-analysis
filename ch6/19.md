# Statement

Let $\gamma_1$ be a curve in $\real{k}$, defined on $\closed{a}{b}; let $\phi$ be a continuous 1-1 mapping of $\closed{c}{d}$ onto $\closed{a}{b}$, such that $\phi(c) = a$; and define $\gamma_2(s) = \gamma_1(\phi(s))$.
Prove that $\gamma_2$ is an arc, a closed curve, or a rectifiable curve if and only if the same is true of $\gamma_1$.
Prove that $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_1$ have the same length.
