# Statement

For $1 < s < \infty$, define

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^s}
$$

(This is Riemann's zeta function, of great importance in the study of the distribution of prime numbers.)
Prove that

(a) $\zeta(s) = s\int_1^\infty \frac{[x]}{x^{s+1}}\d{x}$

and that

(b) $\zeta(s) = \frac{s}{s-1} - s\int_1^\infty\frac{x - [x]}{x^{s+1}}\d{x}$

where $[x]$ denotes the greatest integer $\leq x$.

Prove that the integral in (b) converges for all $s > 0$.

*Hint:* To prove (a), compute the different between the integral on $[1,N]$ and the $N$^th^ partial sum of the series that defines $\zeta(s)$.
