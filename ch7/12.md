# Statement

Suppose $g$ and $f_n$ ($n=1,2,3,\ldots$) are defined on $\open{0}{\infty}$, are Riemann-integrable on $\closed{t}{T}$ whenever $0 < t < T < \infty$, $|f_n| \leq g$, $f_n\to f$ uniformly on every compact subset of $\open{0}{\infty}$, and

$$
\int_0^\infty g(x)\d{x} < \infty
$$

Prove that

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^\infty f_n(x)\d{x} = \int_0^\infty f(x)\d{x}
$$

(See Exercises 7 and 8 of Chap. 6 for the relevant defintions.)

This is a rather weak form of Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem (Theorem 11.32).
Even in the context of the Riemann integral, uniform converge can be replace by pointwise convergence if it is assumed that $f\in\riemann$.
