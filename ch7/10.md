# Statement

Letting $(x)$ denote the function part of the real number $x$ (see Exercise 16, Chap. 4, for the definition), consider the function

$$
  f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{(nx)}{n^2}
$$

for real $x$.
Find all discontinuities of $f$, and show that they form a countable dense set.
Show that $f$ is nevertheless Riemann-integrable on every bounded interval.
