# Statement

Let

$$
f_n(x) =
\begin{cases}
  0 & \left(x < \frac{1}{n+1}\right), \\
  \sin^2 \frac{\pi}{x} & \left(\frac{1}{n+1}\leq x \leq \frac{1}{n}\right), \\
  0 & \left(\frac{1}{n} < x\right).
\end{cases}
$$

Show that $\seq{f_n}$ converges to a continuous function, but not uniformly. Use that series $\sum f_n$ to show that absolute convergence, even for all $x$, does not imply uniform convergence.
