# Statement

Suppose $\seq{f_n},\seq{g_n}$ are defined on $E$, and

(a) $\sum f_n$ has uniformly bounded partial sums;
(b) $g_n\to 0$ uniformly on $E$;
(c) $g_1(x) \geq g_2(x) \geq g_3(x) \geq \cdots$ for every $x\in E$.

Prove that $\sum f_n g_n$ converges uniformly on $E$.
*Hint:* Compare with Theorem 3.42.
